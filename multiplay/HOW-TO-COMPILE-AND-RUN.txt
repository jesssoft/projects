I compiled and tested it on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. The client of this sample is
using SDL2 so it should be installed first before compiling. you should use
g++ which supports C++11. 

** HOW TO COMPILE **

1. Installing SDL2
	./install_libs.sh

2. Compile the common library
	cd common
	make

3. Compile the server
	cd server
	make

4. Compile the client
	cd client
	make

** HOW TO RUN **

1. Run the server
	cd server
	./server_d		# default time-step ms is 100ms
	    or
	./server_d -t 200	# -t means time-step ms(100ms ~ 1000ms)

2. Run the client on the same machine (case 1)
	cd client
	./client_d

3. Run the client on another machine (case 2)
	cd client
	./client_d ip

4. Stopping programmes
	Ctrl + c		# server
	Ctrl + c		# client console
	q or esc		# client play window

** ETC **

If you want to compile them in release mode, see the following.

make mode=release

Thanks for your time!
