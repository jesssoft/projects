I wrote the related codes of the ideas at the following.

[Client-side prediction]

	client/game.cc 		Game::OnKeyboard()
	client/player.cc	Player::UpdatePosDataFromMsg()

[Setting up an authoritative server]

	server/server_d -h	# Display the usage!

[Server time-step]
	
	server/game_server.cc	GameServer::OnEventTimer()

[Server reconciliation]

	client/game.cc:573	DEF_MSG_HANDLER(CS_UPDATE_NTY)
	client/player.cc	Player::OnProcess()

[Sending and receiving time-stamps]

	client/game.cc:507	DEF_MSG_HANDLER(CS_ENTER_WORLD_ACK)
	client/game.cc:573	DEF_MSG_HANDLER(CS_UPDATE_NTY)
	client/game.cc 		Game::OnKeyboard()

** END **
